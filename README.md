# General-video-editing-using-Python

Just a trial to implement some operation on Videos.

Steps to setup the project:
-Drag your video file that you want to animate, inside your project folder.
-Now run "General-video-editing-using-Python/count_frames.py" with [python count_frames.py --video Platformer_Demo_L_1.webm] on cmd/terminal(Replace the name of the video file with your own video).
-Thsi will give you the count of total number of frames of your video. Keep them with you in a text file.
-Now run "General-video-editing-using-Python/Frames_of_Video.py" and all the frames will get generated as a single '.png. image in 'data' folder inside your project.
-Now this gets a little tougher. You manualy need to generate the ascii_art for each frame.
[Any develop's contribution to this project will be highly appreciable]
-To generate the ascii_image of the open and run "Ascii-art-with-Python/ascii_image.py" for each of the frame.
-Now, run "Animating-ascii/Animation.py" to generate the animation.

And you're done! Enjoy and brag among your friends.
